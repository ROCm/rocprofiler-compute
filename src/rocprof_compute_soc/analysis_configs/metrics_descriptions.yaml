          - VALU FLOPs:
              plain: &0201_valu_flops_tip >-
                The total floating-point operations executed per second on the VALU. This is also presented as a percent of
                the peak theoretical FLOPs achievable on the specific accelerator. Note that this does not include any
                floating-point operations from MFMA instructions.
              rst:
                The total floating-point operations executed per second on the :ref:`VALU <desc-valu>`. This is also
                presented as a percent of the peak theoretical FLOPs achievable on the specific accelerator. Note that this
                does not include any floating-point operations from :ref:`MFMA <desc-mfma>` instructions.
          - VALU IOPs:
              plain: &0201_valu_iops_tip >-
                The total integer operations executed per second on the VALU. This is also presented as a percent of the
                peak theoretical IOPs achievable on the specific accelerator. Note that this does not include any integer
                operations from MFMA instructions.
